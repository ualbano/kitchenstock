# Kitchen Stock Management System

## Remarks
I have never vibe code a whole project before, so this is a learning experience for me. 
In this project I am using chatgpt to build this app. Most of the code is generated by chatgpt and my me.
I want to point this out. Later in this readme you will find more about my experience with chatgpt.

## Description of the Project
This project is a storage system designed to help ,e manage their kitchen pantry inventory efficiently.
It allows users to add, update, and delete items in their pantry, as well as view the current stock levels.

I want to work with the barcodes, that every product has. I use this barcode as an unique identifier and gathering Informations.
Thru a barcode scanner (my phone), I can easily add items to my inventory by scanning the barcode.
